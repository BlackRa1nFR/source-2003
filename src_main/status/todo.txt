// TODO

x   Updates for up to 1 day are stored in archive files

The name format is:

x  data/yyyy/mm_dd.txt

x The current data set is appended upon receipt of each sample to

data/unsaved.txt

x at the time when the current day changes, the data for the day is saved and unsaved.lst is reset
x in addition, any loaded data > 2 weeks old is purged from memory

x any time status.exe loads, anything in unsaved.lst is also loaded

x there'll be a dialog for loading data for date ranges in the past

x all data loaded from any file except unsaved.lst will be marked as "from file" and will thus not be re-archived automatically

non-contiguous runs will need to have some kind of new rendering info

x samples loaded from disk will have some visible indicator

the graphs should show a uniform time distribution rather than 1 pixel per sample

There should be a tool to write peak data for all .txt files into a new delimited .txt file that can be loaded into excel
  -- should be able to gather data on one or more specific mods, too

scrolling backward should automatically load old data

x data sets out of view should be released from memory over time (use a memory pool and mru?)

consider loading data sets partially (i.e., don't load modlist unless need to track a specific mod)
